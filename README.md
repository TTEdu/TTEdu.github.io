Developed with the assistance of bootstrap
  - using navbar (originally had a different design but my husband did not like how it looked on mobile so stream lined to his liking)
  - using both card-group and card-deck (to play around with the grouping and non grouping) found this as of right now the easiest 
    way to organize content 
  - within the card-group added a carousel 
  - if you select the button in the navbar it expands with links functioning links
  - navbar is fixed and when focus is lower in the screen on selection of Home focus will return to top
  - link Get A Quote pushes focus to the bottom of the frame where Begin A Custom Quote button allows the user to select 
    and takes advantage of bootstrap JavaScript modal plugin (for a mock information gathering).  On selection of submit returns
    to index.html
  - modal & navbar both have a slide animation I found just to play around with where on the navbar text auto slides and the modal the 
    img slides
  - Gallery links to gallery.html - just a bootstrap example album that I altered as an under construction site with photos and an about
    me blurb.  I had orginally had this blurb overlay on an image but changed the design.  Either selecting the img log / the Home button
    will return the user to the index.html page
  - Contact: directly pulls up email functionality, Instagram, Facebook, & LinkedIn icons all open into a new page with direct links 
    the dark olive drab green I do not love but for time constraints did not redo the .svg I found inverted in white
  - selecting the navbar button will also collapse on selection 
  - card group - first card is carousel, second is a mock instagram feed (that I hope to embed in the future - briefly researched) but 
    selecting the photo will also redirect to instagram in a new tab, third card in this group is a photo that hovers an information
    tag over the image
  - card deck - all three imgages also have a hover option to overlay text none of the buttons in these sections do anything
  - footer includes the modal button, email with a button (that is not active), and the same functionality of contact and social media
    in the navbar
    
Disclaimer... this is still a work in progress

several custom css pieces
only one custom javascript using a function to branch to instagram for the mock instagram feed 

Fun little art I found that for just this occasion [here](https://shop.bubblesort.io/)
